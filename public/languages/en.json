        "paragraph": "Eredi Casassa is one of the oldest shops in Chiavari, as evidenced by it still retains many of the original furnishings of the time, including the beautiful counter and display cabinets with shelves. Inside, Giulio Casassa carries on his family's work, that of the retail sale of electrical equipment, with competence, courtesy and kindness. But to this activity he was able to add a touch of innovation that is very popular with both the Chiavari and the many tourists. From the Casassa heirs you can find all types of light bulbs, electrical spare parts, materials, small metal parts, everything you need for both professionals and do-it-yourselfers. In addition, a careful selection of lamps, chandeliers, objects that Giulio brings to Chiavari being in contact with representatives and companies from all over the world."
